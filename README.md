# GHMD â€“ Global Housing Market Data Analysis

This project analyzes and visualizes the **Global Housing Market** dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to clean, process, and understand the housing trends using powerful Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Seaborn**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

In this project, I:

- Cleaned raw housing data
- Handled missing values
- Renamed columns for better clarity
- Transformed complex values into simpler formats (e.g., converting proportions to percentages)
- Sorted and organized the dataset for analysis
- Used statistical techniques (mean, median, mode) to fill null values
- Created meaningful visualizations to identify trends and outliers

---

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries

- **Pandas** â€“ for data cleaning and manipulation  
- **NumPy** â€“ for numerical operations  
- **Seaborn** â€“ for beautiful and insightful data visualizations  
- *(Optional: Matplotlib or Jupyter Notebook if used)*
